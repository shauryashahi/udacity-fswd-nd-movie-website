Server-side code written in Python to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. This data is then served to a web page using HTML and CSS allowing visitors to review these movies and watch the trailers.

1. Run entertainment_center.py 
2. An HTML file fresh_tomatoes.html is generated.
3. Open the HTML file to navigate through the course project.
